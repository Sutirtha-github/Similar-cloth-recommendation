# Similar-clothes-recommendation

Problem statement: The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of receiving text describing a clothing item and returning a ranked list of links to similar items from different websites.

The ML model used to convert preprocessed text here is GloVe. It has a front-end running on streamlit app which asks the user for a prompt describing the cloth one wants to search and returns top 10 recommendations (URLs) catering to the input description.
